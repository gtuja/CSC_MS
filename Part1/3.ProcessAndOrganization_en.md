- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about work flow and team organization to keep up with further process.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- Here we have a [V-model](https://kruschecompany.com/v-model-software-development-methodology/).<br>
[![V-model](https://kruschecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/V-model-for-software-development-infographic-diagram.png)](https://kruschecompany.com/v-model-software-development-methodology/)
- V-model is a software development and testing methodology that is generally considered a variant of the traditional Waterfall approach. 
- An example of real-world planning is below, which is a reflection of V-Model.<br><br>

- Task Process Flow<br>
![TaskWorkFlow](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_TaskWorkFlow.png)<br>

- For each time slot in the real-world planning, there might be more than one tasks (issue, artifact, etc) shall be created by manager, PM or TPM.
- Each of states on the Task Process Flow might be used as a quantitative evaluation of ongoing project.
- For example if the planed# >>> closed# and pending# and canceled# are not so much, that means there are something wrong with planning.

- Big picture of software development team organization might be below.<br>
![SDD-Organization](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_SoftwareDevelopmentOrganization.png)<br>
- The composition of a team is largely influenced by the scale of development, the added value of the product, and above all, the budget, so it cannot be generalized, but although there are concurrent roles, it is difficult to accept from a quality assurance perspective when the roles of them are cut.
- Here we remind the real-world planning and we're gonna discuss about who is responsible for each of deliverables.

- [TOC](#toc)
- Let's recall [1.1.Basic_Features](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Part1/1.What%20is%20MS.md#Basic_Features).
- Here we do practice how to set [TIMER](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an4013-introduction-to-timers-for-stm32-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf) as an PWM output.
- The GOAL is LED dimming one the evaluation board which is one of the methods to implement SR (System Requirement) that we are gonna practice in Part2.
- At the first check the LED connection on the evaluation board.
- From the P.25 on the [User manual (mb1360)](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2324-stm32-nucleo64-boards-mb1360-stmicroelectronics.pdf), USER LED is marked as LD4.<br>
![LD4](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_LD4.png)
- Next, let's check the [Schematic (mb1360)](https://www.st.com/resource/en/schematic_pack/mb1360-g071rb-c02_schematic.pdf).
- LD4 is powered by 3.3V, current is adjusted to 6.4mA by R28(510R) and it is driven (ON/OFF)by the gate current of FET(T2 BSN20BK) that is connected to **PA5** of MCU.<br>
![Schematic](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_LD4Schematic.png)
- Based on these information, let's configure **PA5** using CubeIDE.
- As we've done before, open the xxx.ioc, select to the Pin Out Configuration -> PA5, we have 2 timer candidates, i.e., TIM2_CH1, TIM2_ETR.
- [ETR (External Trigger Input)](https://blog.embeddedexpert.io/?p=2323) seems to have another uses, let's use TIM2_CH1.<br>
![PA5](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_PA5_Setting.png)
- There are 4 timer setting from the CubeIDE below.<br>
![PA5 Timer Setting](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_PA5_PWM_Setting.png)
  - Mode -> Clock Source -> Internal Clock
  - Mode -> Channel1 -> PWM Generation CH1
  - Parameter Settings -> Counter Setting -> Prescaler (PSC) -> ?
  - Parameter Settings -> Counter Setting -> Counter Period -> ?
- Parameter Settings are related to the PWM frequency, so it is required to a little calculation.
- First is the [PWM frequency](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/79373/how-to-choose-right-pwm-frequency-for-led).
- Refer to the [information](https://www.ledyilighting.com/ja/led-pwm-dimming/), the minimum frequency is about 500-1000Hz.
- Since LD4 is driven by MOS-FET, it may be OK to switch high speed?, let's set it to 10KHz in convenience.
- When it comes to the product development, it is mandatory to evaluate switching noise, LED durability and above all natural dimming.
- Now we have the target PWM frequency, let's set the prescaler and counter period.
- Prescaler is a frequency division that divides the internal clock, i.e., HSE. -> As it becomes lager, the clock decreases, so the PWM frequency becomes lower.
- Counter Period is the expiry time of the TIMER -> As it becomes larger, it will take longer to expire, so the PWM frequency becomes lower.
- The formula is [TIM_CLK/(TIM_PSC + 1)/(TIM_ARR + 1)], details refer to [here](https://qiita.com/ShunHattori/items/68f099f1d77702d2535d).
- Not let's make the PWM frequency to 10KHz, with TIM_PSC(Prescaler) and TIM_ARR(Counter Period).
- In general, set the counter period as large as possible in order to control the dimming level finely.
- Save xxx.ioc then CubeIDE shall generate codes.
- Since it is managed by Git, we can check what happened wit ***Diff***.
