- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about work flow and team organization to keep up with further process.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- Here we have a [V-model](https://kruschecompany.com/v-model-software-development-methodology/).<br>
[![V-model](https://kruschecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/V-model-for-software-development-infographic-diagram.png)](https://kruschecompany.com/v-model-software-development-methodology/)
- V-model is a software development and testing methodology that is generally considered a variant of the traditional Waterfall approach. 
- An example of real-world planning is below, which is a reflection of V-Model.<br><br>

- Task Process Flow<br>
![TaskWorkFlow](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_TaskWorkFlow.png)<br>
- For each time slot in the real-world planning, there might be more than one tasks (issue, artifact, etc) shall be created by manager, PM or TPM.
- Each of states on the Task Process Flow might be used as a quantitative evaluation of ongoing project.
- For example if the planed# >>> closed# and pending# and canceled# are not so much, that means there are something wrong with planning.

- The big picture of software development team organization might be below.<br>
![SDD-Organization](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_SoftwareDevelopmentOrganization.png)<br>
- The composition of a team is largely influenced by the scale of development, the added value of the product, and above all, the budget, so it cannot be generalized, but although there are concurrent roles, it is difficult to accept from a quality assurance perspective when the roles of them are cut.
- Here we remind the real-world planning and we're gonna discuss about who is responsible for each of deliverables.

- [TOC](#toc)
- Let's take a look at the business flow at GitHub as an example.
- The basic work flow on the [Github](https://github.com/).
![Github Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/48032310-63842400-e114-11e8-8db0-06dc0504dcb5.png)
- The basic work flow is [3 - 5] "Create an issue -> Implement -> Pull request", and those are repeated for each deliverable.
