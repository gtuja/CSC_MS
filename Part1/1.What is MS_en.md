- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about MS itself to realize ***where we are***.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- MS development shall deal with MCU, a ***small*** computer on a single integrated circuit and contains one or more CPUs along with **memory** and **programmable peripherals**.
- Why MCU? The most reasonable answer might be ***small***, e.g., cost, size, power consumption, heat generation, etc.

![Market share](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/static/img/research/global-microcontroller-market.png)
- IoT (Embedded System, Medical Device, etc)
  - MCUs are designed to consume ***very little power***, making them ideal for use in portable and other devices that need to operate for long period of time with battery powered.
  - MCUs are an essential component of IoT, smart home, smart building and wearable applications including healthcare.
- Automotive
  - As technology continues to advance, MCUs are being used in a wider range of applications.
  - Modern cars are becoming increasingly sophisticated with features, e.g., ***ADAS, autonomous driving***, etc, and this trends is creating huge business opportunities to MCUs.
- Industrial
  - Industrial MCUs are often designed to be extremely ***rugged and durable***, making them capable of withstanding harsh environments.
  - Industrial MCUs are used to control a wide range of equipment, e.g., machine tools, manufacturing systems, intelligent robots, etc.

> Security
  >> As a connected device for these trends, the risks of cyber-attacks and data breaches continues to increase.<br>
  >> Security features on MCUs, e.g., SSL, TLS, hardware-based security measures help prevent unauthorized access to devices.<br>

- Datasheet
  - Datasheet is a document that explains ***features, functions, pin outs, memory mapping and electrical characteristics*** of the MCU provided by manufacturer.
  - Datasheet shall define ***quantitative information***, e.g., MCU clock, memory size, TIM#, ADC#, etc, it shall be used when ***pick up*** a MCU for each system. 
  - The usage of each function, e.g., TIM, ADC, DAC, etc, might be described at other documents, e.g., peripheral manual, application notes, etc.
  - [stm32f429zi.pdf](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_stm32f429zi.pdf)

- GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
  - One major feature of a MCU is the versatility built into the ***input/output*** circuits that connect the MCU to the ***outside*** world.
  - The number of I/Os depends on the number of pins available on the selected chip.

- Timer 
  - As all MCU are performing some ***real-life*** tasks, so time dependency is very important.
  - Sometimes it termed as counter as well and the Timer/Counter is designed to count cycles of the ***peripheral clock*** or an ***externally-supplied clock***.
  - Timer can optionally generate ***interrupts*** or perform other actions at specified timer values.
  - It also includes ***capture*** inputs to trap the timer value when an input signal transitions.
  - Some MCU have more than one timer function which can work independently but based on priority settings.

- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
  - The UART is one of ***two serial I/O(TX/RX)*** communication basic.
  - The UART can be configured as a full-duplex to communicate with peripheral devices, such as CRT terminals and personal computers.
  - It can also be configured as a half-duplex synchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices, such as A/D or D/A integrated circuits, serial EEPROMs, and so on.
