- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about MS itself to realize **where we are**.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- [TOC](#toc)<br>
- As can be seen from [Trends], the MS industry is dominated by five major supplier ([NXP](https://www.nxp.com/), [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/), [Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/), [ST](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html), [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/)), and it is no exaggeration to say that [ARM](https://www.arm) has been manipulated.
- ARM is a company specializing in the design of reduced instruction set computer ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)), and has expanded its territory since its establishment in the early 1980s, and as of 2005, [75% of 32-bit micro controllers adopt ARM architecture](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%86%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3).
- [According to Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family), ARM Core used in  mobile phone 98%, TV 35%, mobile PC 10% in 2005, and it is said to account for 60% of mobile devices in 2013.
- In the end, only the five largest supplier with the production capacity to withstand the huge ARM licensing costs could survive.
- This is a trend that [孫さん also wants](https://group.softbank/news/press/20160718), and it is also good for us MS engineers. (If you use up one MCU of the five major supplier, the others mostly be the same?)

- MCU Trends<br>
![Market share](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/static/img/research/global-microcontroller-market.png)
- IoT (Embedded System, Medical Device, etc) **45%?**
  - MCUs are designed to consume **very little power**, making them ideal for use in portable and other devices that need to operate for long period of time with battery powered.
  - MCUs are an essential component of IoT, smart home, smart building and wearable applications including healthcare.
- Automotive **24%?**
  - As technology continues to advance, MCUs are being used in a wider range of applications.
  - Modern cars are becoming increasingly sophisticated with features, e.g., **ADAS, autonomous driving**, etc, and this trends is creating huge business opportunities to MCUs.
- Industrial **18%?**
  - Industrial MCUs are often designed to be extremely **rugged and durable**, making them capable of withstanding harsh environments.
  - Industrial MCUs are used to control a wide range of equipment, e.g., machine tools, manufacturing systems, intelligent robots, etc.

- MS development shall deal with MCU, a small computer on a single integrated circuit and contains one or more CPUs along with memory and programmable peripherals.
- Block diagram<br>
   ![Block Diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Common/XML_BlockDiagram.drawio.png)

- Datasheet
  - The very first step in microcontroller development.
  - Datasheet defines quantitative information such as clock, memory, electrical characteristics, TIM#, GPIO#, UART#, etc., and is often used when selecting a system microcontroller.
  - [stm32g0b1cc.pdf](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32g0b1cc.pdf)

- GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
  - The contact point between the microcontroller and the outside world.
  - High/Low control (buttons, LEDs, etc.) is the basic, and can be used in various ways in combination with analog input/output and peripheral functions (Timer, UART, etc.).

- Timer 
  - In charge of the microcontroller metronome.
  - Each has its own counter, which goes up and down using the peripheral clock (more precisely, includes a prescaler), and when it expires, it notifies you with a normal punch (interrupt).
  - Settings such as PWM control are OK, and it is possible to make it completely independent of software implementation.

- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
  - In charge of communication with ICs connected to the microcontroller.
  - There are similar ways, e.g., SPI, I2C, etc., but UART is the basics.<br>
