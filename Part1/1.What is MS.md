- MS development shall deal with MCU, a ***small*** computer on a single integrated circuit and contains one or more CPUs along with **memory** and **programmable peripherals**.
- Why MCU? The most reasonable answer might be ***small***, e.g., cost, size, power consumption, heat generation, etc.

- MCU Trends<br>
![Market share](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/static/img/research/global-microcontroller-market.png)
- IoT (Embedded System, Medical Device, etc)
  - MCUs are designed to consume ***very little power***, making them ideal for use in portable and other devices that need to operate for long period of time with battery powered.
  - MCUs are an essential component of IoT, smart home, smart building and wearable applications including healthcare.
- Automotive
  - As technology continues to advance, MCUs are being used in a wider range of applications.
  - Modern cars are becoming increasingly sophisticated with features, e.g., ***ADAS, autonomous driving***, etc, and this trends is creating huge business opportunities to MCUs.
- Industrial
  - Industrial MCUs are often designed to be extremely ***rugged and durable***, making them capable of withstanding harsh environments.
  - Industrial MCUs are used to control a wide range of equipment, e.g., machine tools, manufacturing systems, intelligent robots, etc.

> Security
  >> As a connected device for these trends, the risks of cyber-attacks and data breaches continues to increase.<br>
  >> Security features on MCUs, e.g., SSL, TLS, hardware-based security measures help prevent unauthorized access to devices.<br>

- Datasheet
  - Datasheet is a document that explains ***features, functions, pin outs, memory mapping and electrical characteristics*** of the MCU provided by manufacturer.
  - Datasheet shall define ***quantitative information***, e.g., MCU clock, memory size, TIM#, ADC#, etc, it shall be used when ***pick up*** a MCU for each system. 
  - The usage of each function, e.g., TIM, ADC, DAC, etc, might be described at other documents, e.g., peripheral manual, application notes, etc.
  - [stm32f429zi.pdf](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part1/Part1_stm32f429zi.pdf)

- GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
  - One major feature of a MCU is the versatility built into the ***input/output*** circuits that connect the MCU to the ***outside*** world.
  - The number of I/Os depends on the number of pins available on the selected chip.

- Timer 
  - As all MCU are performing some ***real-life*** tasks, so time dependency is very important.
  - Sometimes it termed as counter as well and the Timer/Counter is designed to count cycles of the ***peripheral clock*** or an ***externally-supplied clock***.
  - Timer can optionally generate ***interrupts*** or perform other actions at specified timer values.
  - It also includes ***capture*** inputs to trap the timer value when an input signal transitions.
  - Some MCU have more than one timer function which can work independently but based on priority settings.

- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
  - ADC peripheral has different numbers of ***input*** based on the feature or number of pins of the microcontroller used.
  - Additionally, two internal channels are available for sampling the Core supply voltage and VBG absolute ***reference voltage***.
  - This module allows the conversion of an analog input signal to a corresponding digital number.
  - Basic clocking for the A/D converters is provided by the peripheral clock.

- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
  - The UART is one of ***two serial I/O(TX/RX)*** communication basic.
  - The UART can be configured as a full-duplex to communicate with peripheral devices, such as CRT terminals and personal computers.
  - It can also be configured as a half-duplex synchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices, such as A/D or D/A integrated circuits, serial EEPROMs, and so on.

- I2C (Inter IC Communication)
  - I2C is a type of ***Master Synchronous Serial Port*** (MSSP) which is is a half-duplex serial interface.
  - This is useful for communicating with other peripheral or microcontroller devices, serial EEPROMs, shift registers, display drivers, and A/D Converters, etc.
  - I2C compliant bus interfaces that may be configured as Master/Slave.

- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
  - SPI is a type of MSSP but a Full-Duplex serial Communication.
  - It can handle ***multiple masters and slaves*** being connected to a given bus.
  - Only a single master and a single slave can communicate on the interface during a given data transfer.
