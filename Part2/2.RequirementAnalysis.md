- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about requirements.
- Clarify each of requirement definition and try to make up them by ourselves with simple product XLM(X? Light Manager). 
- Without mention, predefined requirements are not the only one way to reach the goal, moving on! shoe me the better world.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- [TOC](#toc)<br>
- There are a lot of definition and methodologies related to requirements.
- Here we do define each of requirements as simple as we can, remember it's not the only one way.
- SR (System Requirement)
  - As mentioned in IEEE Guide for Developing System Requirements Specifications, the basic features for System Requirements are ***capabilities*** those of that system ***needed or desired by the customer***.
  - It's up to the ***needs***, therefore apt to be ***vague or unspecified***.
- SyRS (System Requirement Specification)
  - SyRS might claim against SR, it say ***feasibility***, but still lies in quantitative view.
- SwRS (Software Requirement Specification)
  - SwRS shall define ***possible means*** to satisfy both of SR andd SyRS.
  - There might be multiple way of implementations, some kind of technical details, but it shouldn't restrict actual implementation.
- SwDD (Software Detailed Design)
  - SwDD shall make it clear ***how to implement***.
  - It shall show specific guide how to implement features.
  - Common sense or standards like UML shall be a good way to represent its validity.

- [TOC](#toc)<br>
- Let me have a simple project, XLM(X? Light Manager)
- As an example, here we define requirements below, nagging but it's not the only one.
- SR
  + [SR_0001] System shall retrieve each of button states.
  + [SR_0002] System shall be able to prevent chattering of each buttons.
  + [SR_0003] System shall output each of LED duties.
  + [SR_0004] system shall respond to each of button states and LED outputs at every 1ms.
  + [SR_0005] Button event shall be notified according to the pressed time, if pressed time is less thn 1s set it to short-pressed or not set it to long-pressed.
  + [SR_0006] The match count for button chattering prevention shall be 5.
  + [SR_0007] The fade in and out time shall be 1s and 2s.
  + [SR_0008] The fade in and out shall be done when the short-pressed button event is notified.
  + [SR_0009] LEDs shall be changed on and off immediately when th long press button event is notified.
  > What you say? Isn't it too sophisticated? Anyway just proceed.

- SyRS
  + [SyRS_001] The ***hardware configuration*** might be below. [SR_0001, SR_0003, SR_0004]<br>
   ![Block Diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_XLM_BlockDiagram.drawio.png)
  + [SyRS_002] The ***software configuration*** might be below. [SR_0002, SR_0005 - SR_0009,]
  + [SyRS_003] The maximum number of each buttons and LEDs are 5. [SR_0001, SR_0003] 
  + [SyRS_004] The MCU ***(Stm32xxx)*** have more than 10 free GPIO ports to connect each of buttons and LEDs. [SR_0001, SR_0003] 
  + [SyRS_005] The MCU is driven with XXMhz could afford to process 10 inputs and outputs with providing features, chattering prevention, fade in, fade out, at every 1ms. [SR_0002, SR_0004]
  + [SyRS_006] Built-in ***FreeRTOS*** feature could afford to handle IPCs between LED task and button task notification, e.g., Queue, Semaphore, etc. [SR_0005, SR_0008, SR_0009]
- SwRS
  + [SwRS_001] The ***software block diagram*** shall be below. [SyRS_0002, SyRS_0005, SR_0006]
  + [SwRS_002] FreeRTOS features shall be defined below. [SyRS_005, SyRS_0006]
    * ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) : SysTick [1ms]
    * Tasks : TSK_LED, TSK_BTN, TSK_SWD, etc.
    * Queues : QueTskLed, QueTskBtn, QueTskSwd, etc.
    * Events : EvtBtnSttChanged, EvtLedFadeIn, EvtLedFadeOut, EvtLedOn, EvtLedOff, etc.
  + [SwRS_003] LED task and button task shall handle 5 LEDs and 5 buttons at the same time within 1ms. [SyRS_0003, SyRS_0004]
  + [SwRS_004] Software shall implement button state transitions as a ***static library to extend feasibility***. [SyRS_005]
  + [SwRS_005] Software shall implement LED state transitions as a ***static library to extend feasibility***. [SyRS_005]
- SwDD
  + [SwDD_001] The high level design shall be below. [SwRS_001 - SwRS_002]
  + [SwDD_002] SysTick shall be done at every 1ms. [SwRS_002, SwRS_003]
  + [SwDD_003] SysTick shall be responsible for retrieving each state of buttons notify static library process of XSL.XB(S)M. [SwRS_002, SwRS_004]
  + [SwDD_004] SysTick shall be responsible for retrieving each state of LEDs and calling static library process of XSL.XB(S)M [SwRS_002, SwRS_004]
