- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about requirements.
- Clarify each of requirement definition and try to make up them by ourselves with simple product XLM(X? Light Manager). 
- Without mention, predefined requirements are not the only one way to reach the goal, moving on! show me the better world.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- [TOC](#toc)<br>
- There are a lot of definition and methodologies related to requirements.
- Here we do define each of requirements as simple as we can, remember it's not the only one.
- SR (System Requirement)
  - As mentioned in IEEE Guide for Developing System Requirements Specifications, the basic features for System Requirements are capabilities those of that system **needed or desired by the customer**.
  - It's up to the **needs**, therefore apt to be ***vague or unspecified***.
- SyRS (System Requirement Specification)
  - SyRS might claim against SR, it say **feasibility**, but still lies in a quantitative point of view.
  - There might be multiple way, some kind of technical details, and SyRS shall not restrict actual implementation.
- SwRS (Software Requirement Specification)
  - SwRS shall define **specific method** to satisfy both of SR andd SyRS.
  - SwRS might be tightly link to SwDD, but it still tends to be abstract.
- SwDD (Software Detailed Design)
  - SwDD shall make it clear **how to implement**.
  - It shall have specific guide of how to implement features.
  - Common sense or standards like UML shall be a good way to represent its validity.

- [TOC](#toc)<br>
- Let us have a simple project, XLM(X? Light Manager) as an example.
- Here we define requirements below, nagging but it's not the only one.
- SR
  + [SR_0001] System shall retrieve the button state.
  + [SR_0002] System shall provide chattering prevention of button.
  + [SR_0003] System shall provide fading feature of LED.
  + [SR_0004] system shall respond to button state and LED output at every 1ms.
  + [SR_0005] The button event shall be determined according to the pressed time, if button released after pressed time less then 1s then button event is set to short-pressed and if the pressed time is longer tan 2s then the button event is set to long-pressed immediately.
  + [SR_0006] The match count for button chattering prevention shall be 5.
  + [SR_0007] The fade in and out time shall be 1s and 2s.
  + [SR_0008] The fade in and out shall be done when the short-pressed button event is notified.
  + [SR_0009] LED shall be changed on and off immediately when th long press button event is notified.
  + [SR_0010] System shall provide some kind of logging feature.

  > What you say? Isn't it too sophisticated? Anyway just proceed.

- SyRS
  + [SyRS_001] The **system block diagram** might be below. [SR_0001-SR_0004]<br>
   ![Block Diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_XLM_BlockDiagram.drawio.png)
  + [SyRS_002] The maximum number of each buttons and LEDs are 5. **optional**
  + [SyRS_003] The MCU **STM32G0B1RE** have more than 10 free GPIO ports to connect each of buttons and LEDs. **optional** 
  + [SyRS_004] The MCU is driven with 24Mhz, it could afford to process inputs and outputs with providing features, chattering prevention, fade in, fade out, at every 1ms. [SR_0002-SR_0004]
  + [SyRS_005] **FreeRTOS** shall handle SysTick, and IPC between software features, i.e., tasks, services. [SR_0004, SR_0008, SR_0009]
  + [SyRS_006] ISB (Interrupt Service Button) and ISL (Interrupt Service Button) shall be implemented at SysTick as an ISR module and processed at every 1ms. [SR_0004]
  + [SyRS_007] ISB shall retrieve the button state and is responsible for chattering prevention and extracting button event. [SR_0002, SR_0005, SR_0006]
  + [SyRS_008] ISL shall be processed after ISB to ensure button event consistency. [SR_0008, SR_0009]
  + [SyRS_009] ISL shall provide fading feature with PWM dimming. [SR_0003, SR_0007-SR_0008]
  + [SyRS_010] Tasks, i.e., Button task, LED task, SWD, shall be , e.g., IBS, ILS, BT, LT, SWDT the outside world, e.g., PC.[SR_0010]
  
  + [SyRS_010] SWD task shall play a relay role between system, e.g., IBS, ILS, BT, LT, SWDT the outside world, e.g., PC.[SR_0010]
  + [SyRS_010] Button and LED task shall handle messages from services, i.e., Button service, LED service. a relay role with the outside system, e.g., PC.[SR_0010]

- SwRS
  + [SwRS_001] The **software block diagram** shall be below. [SyRS_0002, SR_0006]
  + [SwRS_002] FreeRTOS features shall be defined below. [SyRS_0006]
    * SysTik(1ms) : 
    * Tasks : TSK_LED, TSK_BTN, TSK_SWD.
    * Queues : QueTskLed, QueTskBtn, QueTskSwd, etc.
  + [SwRS_003] LED task and button task shall handle 5 LEDs and 5 buttons at the same time within 1ms. [SyRS_0003, SyRS_0004]
  + [SwRS_004] Software shall implement button state transitions as a ***static library to extend feasibility***. [SyRS_005]
  + [SwRS_005] Software shall implement LED state transitions as a ***static library to extend feasibility***. [SyRS_005]
- SwDD
  + [SwDD_001] The high level design shall be below. [SwRS_001 - SwRS_002]
  + [SwDD_002] SysTick shall be done at every 1ms. [SwRS_002, SwRS_003]
  + [SwDD_003] SysTick shall be responsible for retrieving each state of buttons notify static library process of XSL.XB(S)M. [SwRS_002, SwRS_004]
  + [SwDD_004] SysTick shall be responsible for retrieving each state of LEDs and calling static library process of XSL.XB(S)M [SwRS_002, SwRS_004]
