- In this chapter we're gonna discuss about requirements.
- Clarify each of requirement definition and try to make up them by ourselves with simple product XLM(X? Light Manager). 
- Without mention, predefined requirements are not the only one way to reach the goal, moving on! show me the better world.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- [TOC](#toc)
- There are a lot of definition and methodologies related to requirements.
- Here we do define each of requirements as simple as we can, remember it's not the only one.
- SR (System Requirement)<br>
\- As mentioned in IEEE Guide for Developing System Requirements Specifications, the basic features for System Requirements are capabilities those of that system **needed or desired by the customer**.<br>
\- It's up to the **needs**, therefore apt to be ***vague or unspecified***.<br>
- SyRS (System Requirement Specification)<br>
\- SyRS might claim against SR, it say **feasibility**, but still lies in a quantitative point of view.<br>
\- There might be multiple way, some kind of technical details, and SyRS shall not restrict actual implementation.<br>
- SwRS (Software Requirement Specification)<br>
\- SwRS shall define **specific method** to satisfy both of SR andd SyRS.<br>
\- SwRS might be tightly link to SwDD, but it still tends to be abstract.<br>
- SwDD (Software Detailed Design)<br>
\- SwDD shall make it clear **how to implement**.<br>
\- It shall have specific guide of how to implement features.<br>
\- Common sense or standards like UML shall be a good way to represent its validity.<br>
\- Regarding SwDD, we're gonna look inside at [3.3.Software Design](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Part2/3.SoftwareDesign.md).

<summary><font size="5"><b>Project XLM</b></font></summary>

- [TOC](#toc)
- Let us have a simple project, XLM(X? Light Manager) as an example.
- Here we define requirements below, nagging but it's not the only one.
- SR<br>
\- [SR_01] System shall retrieve the button state.<br>
\- [SR_02] System shall change LED brightness.<br>
\- [SR_03] system shall respond to button state and LED output at every 1ms.<br>
\- [SR_04] System shall provide chattering prevention of button.<br>
\- [SR_05] The match count for button chattering prevention shall be 5.<br>
\- [SR_06] System shall handle button events shall be determined according to the pressed time, if button released after pressed time less then 1s then short-pressed event shall be notified, and if the pressed time is longer than 2s then the long-pressed event shall be immediately.<br>
\- [SR_07] System shall provide fading feature for LED.<br>
\- [SR_08] Fade in shall be done during 1s, when the short-pressed button event is notified under off state.<br>
\- [SR_09] Fade out shall be done during 2s, when the short-pressed button event is notified under on state.<br>
\- [SR_10] LED shall be switched on or off immediately when th long-press button event is notified.<br>
\- [SR_11] System shall provide some kind of logging feature.<br>
> What you say? Isn't it too sophisticated? Anyway just proceed.
- SyRS<br>
\- [SyRS_01] The **system block diagram** might be below. [SR_01-SR_04]<br>
![System Block Diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_XLM_BlockDiagram.drawio.png)<br>
\- [SyRS_02] The MCU **STM32G0B1RE** has more than 10 free GPIO ports to connect each of buttons and LEDs. [SR_01, SR_02]<br> 
\- [SyRS_03] The MCU is driven up to 64Mhz, it could afford to process inputs and outputs with providing features, i.e., chattering prevention, fade in, fade out, at every 1ms. [SR_03]<br>
\- [SyRS_04] Some kind of OS feature, e.g., FreeRTOS, shall handle periodic processes and tasks. [SR_03, SR_10]<br>
\- [SyRS_05] Button and LED control shall be processed as a periodic process, e.g., SysTick, to be punctual on the response time (1ms). [SR_03]<br>
\- [SyRS_06] Button control shall retrieve the button state and is responsible for chattering prevention, defined in [SR_04, SR_05], and extracting button events, i.e., short-press, long-press, defined in [SR_06] [SR_01, SR_04, SR_05, SR_06]<br>
\- [SyRS_07] LED control shall be processed after Button control process to ensure the button event consistency. [SR_08, SR_09, SR_10]<br>
\- [SyRS_08] LED process shall provide fading feature, defined in [SR_07, SR_08, SR_09] with PWM timer. [SR_07, SR_08, SR_09]<br>
\- [SyRS_09] System shall provide some kind of logging feature to PC.[SR_10]<br>
- SwRS<br>
\- [SwRS_01] The **software block diagram** shall be below. [SyRS_01, SyRS_04]<br>
![Software Block Diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_XLM_BlockDiagram_Software.drawio.png)<br>
