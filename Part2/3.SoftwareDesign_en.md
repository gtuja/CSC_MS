- In this chapter, we're gonna look into SwDD (Software Detailed Design), so-called software design.
- First of all, let's recall the system block diagram of [Part2.2. Requirement Analysis](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Part2/2.RequirementAnalysis.md#project_alm).
- From an abstract point of view, they could be thought of as functional blocks and wiring.
- In terms of software, each of them is called **module and an interface**.
- Make them clear is the first step. Modules and interfaces are not unique (blocks/wiring), and they are on your way of thinking.
- Here we go, practice with a specific method.
- Keep in mind [Golden ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [Affordance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), divide and conquer with [Occam's razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

- The purpose of HLD is to clarify modules and interfaces.
- We're gonna look at it with package diagram and sequence diagram.
- Package diagram<br>
\* The package diagram is based on [Software block diagram](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_ALM_SoftwareBlockDiagram.drawio.png). Block might be divided into several modules. <br>
\* Also clarify dependencies by defining interfaces between modules. <br>
\* The name defined here is used for folder structure, file name, APIs, etc. <br>
\* Therefore naming sense, that is an easy-to-understand and short English expression, is necessary and this will also affect software implementation. <br>

- Sequence diagram<br>
\* Sequence diagram is definitely time series.<br>
\* This is an ordered list of interfaces between modules, which is intuitive and easy to understand. <br>
\* Control within a module is difficult to express with it, let's leave it to Detailed Design. <br>

- Here we have software design that is how to implement SwRD.
- DS(Data Structure)<br>
\* DS could be said of mass of data.<br>
\* In the software design, they say if the interface is the flower then the DS is the soil.<br>
\* In the MS field, a lot of software are written in C language, compared to OOP(Object Oriented Programming), DS plays an important role in software design.<br>
\* We're gonna design DS assuming implementation in C-language with all round player class diagram<br>
\* In addition, let's add interfaces also.<br>
\* Since we borrowed class diagram from OOP, we're gonna use the words of OOP.<br>
\* "+" means public, in the C project, it might be implemented at header file<br>
\* "-" means private, it might be as static in C.<br>
\* All right, we're fonna start from examples.<br>

- SMD(State Machine Diagram)<br>
\* SMD is based on the State Diagram and that implementation is tends to be typical.<br>
\* It might be hard to explain, so it's better to dive into the codes.<br>

![ALM_StateMachineDiagram_XLM](https://github.com/gtuja/CSC_MS/blob/main/Resources/Part2/Part2_ALM_StateMachineDiagram_XLM.drawio.png)<br>

- Flow Chart<br>
\* The flow chart is focus on the control that represents flow from entry to exit of each modules.<br>
\* Intuitive and easy one that everyone is lovin except designer might be the last station before implementation.<br>
\* The more requirements are complicated, the more it's hard to cover them with flow chart.<br>
\* Sometimes it's harder than coding itself so it's not unusual code review instead.<br>
